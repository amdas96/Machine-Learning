# Machine-Learning

## CNBE, a prominent news channel, is gearing up to provide insightful coverage of recent elections, recognizing the importance of data-driven analysis. A comprehensive survey has been conducted, capturing the perspectives of 1525 voters across various demographic and socio-economic factors. This dataset encompasses 9 variables, offering a rich source of information regarding voters' characteristics and preferences.

### Objective
  The primary objective is to leverage machine learning to build a predictive model capable of forecasting which political party a voter is likely to support. This predictive model, developed based on the       provided information, will serve as the foundation for creating an exit poll. The exit poll aims to contribute to the accurate prediction of the overall election outcomes, including determining which party is likely to secure the majority of seats.
